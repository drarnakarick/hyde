title: Two-day Unix/Python Workshop Wrap-up
---

Earlier this week we ran the first two-day Unix/Python workshop for PhD students and research staff interested in getting started with Python. The <a href="http://drarnakarick.github.io/2015-05-04-swinpython/"> workshop</a> was led by Swinburne's  newly minted Software Carpentry instructors, Ewan Barr and Genevieve Shattow, with the (much appreciated) help from a small team of unix and python experts from the Centre of Astrophysics and Supercomputing.

#### Lesson Plans
* Unix shell lesson plan: [shell-novice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
* Python lesson plan: [python-novice-inflammation](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).
* Version control with git lesson plan: [git-novice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).
