title: Two-day Unix/Python Workshop Wrap-up
---

Earlier this week we ran the first two-day Unix/Python workshop for PhD students and research staff interested in getting started with Python. The [workshop] (http://drarnakarick.github.io/2015-05-04-swinpython/) was led by our two newly minted Software Carpentry Instructors, Ewan Barr and Genevieve Shattow, With the (much appreciated) help from a small group of Unix and Python experts from the Centre of Astrophysics and Supercomputing.
