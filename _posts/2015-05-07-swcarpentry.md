title: Two-day Unix/Python Workshop Wrap-up
---


#### Workshop review

Earlier this week we ran our first two-day Unix/Python workshop for PhD students and research staff interested in getting started with Python. The <a href="http://drarnakarick.github.io/2015-05-04-swinpython/"> workshop</a> was led by Swinburne'snewly minted Software Carpentry instructors, Ewan Barr and Genevieve Shattow, with help from a small team of unix and python experts from the Centre of Astrophysics and Supercomputing.

Since this workshop was designed to teach general python skills participants came from a variety of research disciplines (see below for an interactive profile of participants). Consequently there was a large spread in programming experience and ability (and even operating system). We chose to install software locally rather than using a pre-configured cloud instance. While this takes a little more effort it meant that participants could use the
