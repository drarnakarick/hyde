title: Two-day Unix/Python Workshop Wrap-up
---


#### Workshop review

Earlier this week we ran our first two-day Unix/Python workshop for PhD students and research staff interested in getting started with Python. The <a href="http://drarnakarick.github.io/2015-05-04-swinpython/"> workshop</a> was led by Swinburne'snewly minted Software Carpentry instructors, Ewan Barr and Genevieve Shattow, with help from a small team of unix and python experts from the Centre of Astrophysics and Supercomputing.

Since this workshop was designed to teach general python skills participants came from a variety of research disciplines (see below for an interactive profile of participants). Consequently there was a large spread in programming experience and ability (and even operating system). 

We chose to install software locally rather than using a pre-configured cloud instance. While this takes a little more effort it meant that participants could set up their own GitHub accounts, gitbash shell and python (Anaconda) installation for use later on. It also gives them a better understanding of how their laptop operates. Fortunately this went rather smoothly. We anticipated that the first half of the first session would be spent troubleshooting Linux, Windows and Mac OSX issues, but this wasn't case. A few days before the workshop we held an hour long helper meeting where participants could come and get help setting up laptops. This turned out to be a really good idea and we'll definitely be offering that next time. 

The first session on the Unix shell was a little hit and miss I think - mostly becuase of the material. If you've  used the shell throughout your PhD I don't think you get much out of this session, unless you want to brush up on scripting. If you've never used it (or even heard of it) it can be quite baffling. Genevieve did an excellent job teaching this session which is more conceptual than the rest of the workshop. I've noticed that at Python workshops at other instutions, the Unix shell session is often presented as optional pre-workshop homework, allowing more time for Python and SQL.

Python was our language of choice, because itâ€™s free, intuitive and popular. This did not mean that only Python users (or potential users) would benefit from the boot camp. Since the focus is on general programming skills that are transferable to any language, focussing on Python basics is really useful. We covered the most useful elements; loops and conditional statements ("for", "if", "else" etc.) and functions. 

The structure of the workshop was guided teaching with group challenges thrown in along the way. Of course we spent more time on each session than originally planned, but this seems to be typical of Software Captentry courses - too much (great!) material, too little time.
